The data set is derived from kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/gene-expression.
These data represent expression profiles of cancer patients. 
Gene expression is measured using microarrays. Two types of cancer are included: acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
The data are analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) which is a common dimension reduction technique.
The file "1_ALL_AML_train_and_test_data_set_PCA_ .ipynb" contains PCA of training and test data sets.
The file "2_ALL_AML_whole_data_PCA_.ipynb" is intended to compare PCA of the whole data both with normalizing and without it.
"3_ALL_AML_correlation_analysis_coregulated_genes" is an attempt to create a rough pattern for coregulated genes search, 
which may be of great interest in some study
